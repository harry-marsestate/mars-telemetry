# Security notes

## RLS auto-enable gotcha

Every new table in `public` automatically gets RLS enabled by the ensure_rls
event trigger (rls_auto_enable()), but NO policy is auto-created - Postgres's
default with RLS on + zero policies is deny-all to everyone except the table
owner. This bit us once already: anomaly_thresholds was invisible to real
users for a while before we caught it via end-to-end testing.

Known dormant instances (RLS on, no policy, not yet reachable by any
non-SECURITY-DEFINER path, so not currently broken - but WILL silently break
the moment something queries them directly):
- customer_block_access, user_profiles (only reachable via SECURITY DEFINER
  helper functions today)
- tanks, block_lots (tied to deferred ferm/tanks/fruit real-data work)
- work_type_lookup (tied to deferred labour panel real-data work)
- stg_sensor_readings (dbt staging table, should probably stay deny-all
  permanently - not meant for app access)

RULE: whenever you wire up a new table to real frontend/RPC access, check
pg_policies for it FIRST, before assuming GRANT SELECT alone is sufficient -
grants and RLS policies are two independent gates, and satisfying one says
nothing about the other.
